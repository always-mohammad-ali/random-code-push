<p>HEY sir, i using paragraph tag for the very first time. How is it look like?</p>

<b>It is bold tag, for creating a bold text/word.</b>

<p><strong>It is strong tag. Bold and strong output scenery is almost same, because they both are fat/thick, But strong tag means meaningful(semantics)</strong></p>

<i>Lets go baby to meloni italiano. Its italic tag.</i>

<p><em>It's emphasize tag. Its output same as italic but when a developer see the code, they will understand it is used for importance and meaningful. It is also semantics tag(meaningful).</em></p>
